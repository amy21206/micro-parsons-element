Washtenaw County Fairgrounds (1883–1892)
Main article: Washtenaw County Fairgrounds
In the early days of Michigan football, Michigan played smaller home games at the Washtenaw County Fairgrounds with larger games being held in Detroit at the Detroit Athletic Club.[114] The Fairgrounds were originally located at the southeast intersection of Hill and Forest, but in 1890 moved to what is now called Burns Park.[114]

Regents Field (1893–1905)

In 1890, the Board of Regents authorized $3,000 ($78,947.37 in 2014 dollars) for the purchase of a parcel of land along South State Street.[115] In 1891 a further $4,500 ($118,421.05 in 2014 dollars) was authorized "for the purpose of fitting up the athletic field."[115] Michigan began play on Regents Field in 1893, with capacity being expanded to over 15,000 by the end of the field's use.[115]

Ferry Field (1906–1926)
Main article: Ferry Field
By 1902 Regents Field had grown inadequate for the uses of the football team as a result of the sport's increasing popularity.[116] Thanks to donations from Dexter M. Ferry, work began on planning the next home stadium for the Michigan football team. Powered by a $30,000 donation from Ferry, Ferry Field was constructed with a maximum temporary capacity of 18,000 for the 1906 season.[116] Ferry Field was expanded to a capacity of 21,000 in 1914 and 42,000 in 1921.[116] However, attendance was often over-capacity with crowds of 48,000 cramming into the small stadium.[116] This prompted athletic director Fielding Yost to contemplate the construction of a much larger stadium.

Michigan Stadium (1927–present)
Main article: Michigan Stadium

Fielding H. Yost anticipated massive crowds as college football's popularity increased and wished to build a stadium with a capacity of at least 80,000.[34] Ultimately, the final plans authorized the construction of a stadium with a capacity of 72,000 with footings to be set in place to expand it beyond 100,000 later.[34] Michigan Stadium was dedicated in 1927 during a game against the Ohio State Buckeyes, drawing an over-capacity crowd of 84,401.[117] After World War II, crowd sizes increased, prompting another stadium expansion to a capacity of 93,894 in 1949.[117] Michigan Stadium cracked the 100,000 mark by expanding to 101,001 in 1955.[117] Michigan Stadium temporarily lost the title of "largest stadium" to Neyland Stadium of the Tennessee Volunteers in 1996, but recaptured the title in 1998 with another expansion to 107,501.[118] In 2007, the Board of Regents authorized a $226 million renovation to add a new press box, 83 luxury boxes, and 3,200 club seats.[119] For the 2011 season, lights were installed at Michigan Stadium at the cost of $1.8 million.[120] This allowed Michigan to play its first night game at home against Notre Dame in 2011.[121]
